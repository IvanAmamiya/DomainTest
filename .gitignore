# PyTorch models (large files)
# Model files are often large and should be ignored if not distributing them.
# Specific model paths from your scripts:
# - results/comparison_*/best_*.pth (Covered by results/)
# - models/best_model.pth (If you use this path)
# General rules:
*.pth
models/best_model.pth # If you save specific models here outside results/
